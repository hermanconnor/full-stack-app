# Full Stack React App

React was used to develop a user interface for a school database REST API, that was developed using Nodejs and Express. A user can view all courses as well as view the details of a specific course. Once signed in, a user can create, read, update, or delete a course. A user can only update and delete a course if they are the owner the course.
